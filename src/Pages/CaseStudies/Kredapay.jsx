              Kredapay's journey is rooted in solving real-world challenges. The company's founders identified 
              a pressing need for reliable and user-friendly financial services in Nigeria.
            </p>

            <p>
              From those early days of envisioning better payment solutions, Kredapay evolved into a dynamic 
              platform with a suite of financial products tailored to modern needs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially focused on secure payment gateways, Kredapay quickly grew to offer products like 
              Virtual Cards, enabling users to shop globally and conduct secure online transactions.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, as the company scaled, it faced operational bottlenecks that hindered its growth.
